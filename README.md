-**Real-time detection of helmets and vests using YOLOv11.**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing construction site safety by detecting helmets and vests in images using a YOLOv11-based object detection model. Trained on the **Hard Hat Dataset** from Kaggle, our model ensures compliance with safety regulations and minimizes workplace hazards through real-time monitoring.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
We used the [Hard Hat Workers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetzahitaydn/hardhat-vest-dataset-v3) from Kaggle, which contains labeled images of construction workers wearing or missing safety gear.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Model:** YOLOv11
- **Framework:** UltraLytics
- **Dataset:** Hard Hat Workers Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
